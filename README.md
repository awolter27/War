# War

Project 1

## Website

-  https://awolter27.github.io/War/
- I'm planning to add in a responsive web design to optimize viewing on screens of different sizes. Unfortunately, until then you may need to zoom out with Ctrl + - to see the entire page.

## Rules

- Two players are dealt 26 cards (face down) into their decks.
- Two players will simultaneously flip over 1 card (face up) from the top of their decks.
- The player who has the card with the highest rank will take both cards and place them (face down) at the bottom of their deck.
- If both players flip over cards with the same rank, there's a war. Both players will place down 3 cards (face down) from the top of their decks. Both players will then simultaneously flip over 1 card (face up) from the top of their decks. If both players flip over cards of the same rank again, there's another war. The player who ultimately flips over the card with the highest rank will take all of the cards and place them at the bottom of their deck.
- The first player to get all 52 cards in their deck wins the game.

## Card Rankings (in ascending order)

- 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A

## Stretch Goals

- Players will be able to choose from various icons to place next to their usernames.
- When the player clicks the buttons, they should flash a different color, so the player knows the browswer responded to their click.
- There will be a responsive web design to optimize viewing on screens of different sizes.
- There will be a warning if the player decides to click restart during the middle of the game.
- There will be animations depicting the cards flip over.
- There will be animations depicting the cards sliding into the decks.
